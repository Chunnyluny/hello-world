sandbox repo to understand github
I'm trying to understand github and pushing, pulling, commmitting, and merging stuff. Also be aware that markdown is not the same as XML, HTML or TXT files. They all have their own syntax. I will try to make a short summary on how I will learn to use github, by working in this sandbox, here I can do push, pull, merge whatever, before I mess up my real mod. Since I don't know what I'm doing, I need to keep track on my learning journey. I also don't need to delete it from my profile, so I can look back at the begin of my coding and realise later that I made some progress in learning how to use git.

added reasons to use a sandbox repository to learn how git works. and how I need to use git flow to have version control and branches  to work with. I also understand that commits are like temporary workspaces where you can continue, where you have left off. stupid thing is. when you are typing in github web interface it needs to be refreshed to show changes. And you can't save while typing a lot of text.
